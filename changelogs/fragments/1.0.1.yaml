release_summary: >-
  This release fixes a bug with Keystone endpoint generation when SSL is disabled,
  and changes variable defaults so that the collection is easier to run on standard
  deployments made using Kolla-Ansible.

minor_changes:
  - >-
    Add a new ``distil_api_url`` inventory variable for dynamically generating (or overriding)
    the "public facing" Distil API URL.
    ``distil_keystone_endpoint_url`` now references this new variable.
  - >-
    Change the default value for ``distil_keystone_user_project`` to ``service``,
    to make it easier to set up the collection to deploy to OpenStack deployments
    created using Kolla-Ansible.

bugfixes:
  - >-
    When SSL is disabled for Distil API, make sure the Keystone service endpoint URL
    is generated as an HTTP URL, instead of HTTPS.
