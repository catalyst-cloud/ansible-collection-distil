release_summary: >-
  This release fixes a number of bugs, and adds/modifies the options for the collection
  to make configuring Distil more flexible.

minor_changes:
  - >-
    Add a new ``distil_api_url`` inventory variable for dynamically generating (or overriding)
    the "public facing" Distil API URL.
    ``distil_keystone_endpoint_url`` now references this new variable.
  - >-
    Change the default value for ``distil_keystone_user_project`` to ``service``,
    to make it easier to set up the collection to deploy to OpenStack deployments
    created using Kolla-Ansible.
  - >-
    Make it possible to dynamically configure the RBAC policy using the
    ``distil_rbac_policy`` inventory variable.

bugfixes:
  - >-
    When SSL is disabled for Distil API, make sure the Keystone service endpoint URL
    is generated as an HTTP URL, instead of HTTPS.
  - >-
    Set the RBAC policy file in Distil so that it looks at ``policy.yaml``,
    instead of the default ``policy.json``.
