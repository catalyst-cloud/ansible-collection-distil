      release_summary: Initial release of the Ansible collection for OpenStack Distil.
    fragments:
    - 1.0.0.yaml
    release_date: '2024-05-23'
  1.0.1:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Set the RBAC policy file in Distil so that it looks at ``policy.yaml``, instead
        of the default ``policy.json``.
      - When SSL is disabled for Distil API, make sure the Keystone service endpoint
        URL is generated as an HTTP URL, instead of HTTPS.
      minor_changes:
      - Add a new ``distil_api_url`` inventory variable for dynamically generating
        (or overriding) the "public facing" Distil API URL. ``distil_keystone_endpoint_url``
        now references this new variable.
      - Change the default value for ``distil_keystone_user_project`` to ``service``,
        to make it easier to set up the collection to deploy to OpenStack deployments
        created using Kolla-Ansible.
      - Make it possible to dynamically configure the RBAC policy using the ``distil_rbac_policy``
        inventory variable.
      release_summary: This release fixes a number of bugs, and adds/modifies the
        options for the collection to make configuring Distil more flexible.
